📣10% OFF THROUGHOUT OCTOBER 📣
To celebrate the launch of Wake’s Autocare, any vehicle service booked in for October will receive 10% off the final bill. 
We have had a fantastic busy start since we announced the business, here’s a small insight as to what we have been up to…
Volkswagen Golf - Main crank oil seal leaking, this was noticed by us on a previous visit. The customer was rebooked to suit their needs and we replaced the main crank seal, cambelt, waterpump and carried out an oil and filter replacement using all Genuine Volkswagen parts.
Citroen C3 - customer contacted us requesting a replacement engine after the vehicle was diagnosed elsewhere with no compression on cylinder 3. We sourced a low mileage replacement engine and fitted it at the customers request. 
Toyota Aygo - Vehicle failed its MOT on emissions, upon removing Bank 1 lambda sensor, the sensor had pulled the threads out of the manifold. We sourced and fitted a new replacement manifold and replaced both pre and post cat lambda sensors. 
Volkswagen Passat - Customer contacted us with a battery drain overnight which meant the vehicle would need to be jump started every morning. We quickly found the rear RH door control module to be faulty causing the convenience CAN network to stay awake. Genuine replacement part sourced and fitted.
