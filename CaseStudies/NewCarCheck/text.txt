Recently purchased a car? ✅ 
Want it inspected for piece of mind? ✅ 
We were contacted by one of our customers after purchasing this stunning 2019 Audi Q5. 
A week into ownership the car developed a couple of faults, here’s one of them: 
Airbag light illuminated on dash. ⚠️
Passenger rear seat belt: resistance too high.
We removed the rear quarter panel and found a disconnected seat belt with a resistor in its place 😮. 
We have also been busy with all sort of other work. 
Audi A4 in for diagnostics and coilover adjustment  ⬆️⬇️
Mercedes A150 in for its annual service 📋
BMW 3 series Msport in for a light fault. We traced this to a burn out earth. ⚡️
