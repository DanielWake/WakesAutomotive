For a business that wishes to create a web presence that advertises their services in many areas in the uk - towns, cities and counties within the same country. What would be the best form of web application to achieve the above?

Would flat file websites be best or would something like MVC be better?

They want to appear high in search engine rankings for ‘______ in my area’ and ‘<area> <service>’
